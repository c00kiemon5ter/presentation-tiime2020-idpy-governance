### Governance and Challenges <br/> in OSS IAM Projects

_how to establish a community, sustainable work models_
<br/>
_and choose the right licenses and protocols._

#### The case of IdentityPython


<small>Ivan Kanakarakis &mdash; SUNET</small>


notes:

- hello all, I'm Ivan

- it's a pleasure to be here, in Vienna with this lovely weather; who would expect!
- before I start, I want to say thanks to the organizers and coordinators
  that make this event possible every year

- we're going to go through
  - what is IdPy
  - how it is organized
  - the current challenges

- I have about 10mins, only, so this will be just a quick overview

### What is IdentityPython?

* a set of python _projects_ that provide implementations
  of key federation and identity _technologies_

* an _organization_ established to facilitate an open, transparent and efficient
  _governance process_ for the IdentityPython _community_


notes:

- so, what is IdentityPython?

- IdPy is a common roof for python projects related to identity management
- the projects are implementations of key federation and identity technologies
  such as: SAML, OpenID-Connect, OAuth, and more
- you've probably already heard about some projects, like the pyFF metadata aggregator or the SATOSA proxy

- but at the same time, IdPy is
  an organization with the goal of managing the wider community
- it does that by setting the processes by which the community agrees-on-changes regarding the projects

- so, you can already see that there are two sides
  - one is technical; and deals with projects, technology, code, etc
  - the other is "social"; and it is all about the community,
    what the community expects from the tools and how the community uses the tools

### How IdPy is organized

* hosted under the Commons Conservancy foundation
* driven by a board and the makers
* invests in the community


notes:

- with this in mind, let's see how idpy is organized
  focusing on the community side of things

- IdPy started by collecting the different projects around the middle of 2017
- today, it is a formal organization under the umbrella of the Commons Conservancy foundation
- CC gives IdPy a light-weight and flexible governance framework
  - it features ready-made processes for member structure and decision making
  - as well as, processes on how copyrights are assigned, or how donations can be accepted

- IdPy is driven by a board
  - the board documents the community processes
  - it makes decisions regarding the organization such as, inclusion or removal of a project
  - and coordinates processes on behalf of the community, for example coordinating incident responses and security fixes

- however, projects themselves are managed by their makers
  with some exception, such as licensing
  - the chosen license for the projects is Apache 2.0
  - at the same time, copyright and IPR go to CC

- we also do our best to reach and keep in touch with the community:
  - biweekly we have online meetings where we do planning, discuss changes and get feedback
  - we participate at events with talks and organize hackathons and workshops
  - we have multiple communication channels:
    - dedicated slack workspace
    - github issues
    - mailing lists: idpy-discuss / satosa-{users,developers} / pyff-{users,dev}

- **Sustainability**
- so, how does this work out in terms of sustainability?
- our "business model" (if you want to put it that way) is to serve the community

- funding comes through NREN and GEANT projects that use the tools provided by IdPy
- the people that work on IdPy projects do participate and are funded through such projects
- those funded projects (at least in-part) reflect the community needs

- this also means that funding is not directed on IdPy tools themselves
- but comes indirectly through the projects that use the tools
- those have specific goals and deliverables and play a big part on the agenda of each IdPy project

- **Makers and use-cases**
- this relation also brings the makers in contact with the use-cases of their products
- that gives them a direct perspective of what the real needs are
- by participating in such projects, duplication can be identified and removed
- the work is then open sourced and upstreamed and in the end the whole community benefits

### Challenges

* be part of the community
* manage time and priorities


notes:

- so, value comes by listening to the community needs and cattering for those
- rather than, setting goals within the IdPy projects themselves, that may not be effectively used by the community
- by being open and investing in the community, we benefit both the projects that use our tools and the wider IdPy community

- after having gone through the process of
  - filling paperwork
  - establishing the organization
  - making decisions on what our primary focus is
  - making decisions on how we make decisions and communicate
  - we have the basis grow

- the challange is then to create and foster a relationship with the community
- we do not have customers; we have users and contributors
- and we are not in isolation from them; instead we are ourselves users too (aka dogfooding)
- which means that we don't provide value only to others, but to ourselves too

- having established all this, the current challenge is
- that time is limited, but the "wants" of users are unlimited
- we try to find ways to manage priorities as effective as we can, to the benefit of most
  - sometimes there are conflicting needs
  - but what we strive for, is to understand each other, rather than classifying something as right or wrong
  - we believe that constructive discussion is about mutual understanding, not about mutual agreement
